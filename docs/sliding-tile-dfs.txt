The environment is implemented in a way such that the possible actions to be taken from a given state are always ordered in the following fashion: up, right, down, left. If the empty tile is placed near a border, some of those actions are not considered, but the order remains the same. For that reason, DFS will prioritize moves that lead the empty tile to the top of the board.
