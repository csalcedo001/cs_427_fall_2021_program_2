The heuristic for this puzzle is rather unecessary because of the small number of states (32 counting invalid states). A simple heuristic is described in heuristics.txt, which constists of counting the number of warewolves in the west side of the river. This heuristic is admissible and indirectly reduces the number of vampires on the west side too as a means to meet the constrains posed by the problem. It reaches a solution in a few number of steps.
