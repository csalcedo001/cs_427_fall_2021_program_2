The heuristic chosen for this puzzle, as described in heuristics.txt, consists of choosing the cost from the sum of the minimum number of position exchanges from each tile to any of its final positions. This is an admissible heuristic, but it is still not sufficiently tight to make the search procedure return a result if the initial tile configuration is too far away from any end position. This is the case because there are a total of 16! = 20,922,789,888,000 possible configurations, which result in inadmissible time and space requirements for uninformed search procedures, and still huge requirements for this informed search approach.
