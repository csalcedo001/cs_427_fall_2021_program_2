sliding_tile heuristic:
Relax the constraints of the game by allowing any pair of tiles to exchange positions (the original rules only allow tiles to be exchanged with the empty tile). In these conditions, we can use as heuristic the sum of the minimum number of position exchanges each tile should take to reach any of its final positions (each tile can be in any of two final positions depending on where the empty tile ends). This heuristic is admissible because the total number of position exchanges is necessarily equal or less than the number of exchanges in the game with its original rules. This is the case because the mechanics of position exchange remain the same but the aditional constraints from the original game make the path longer than in the version with relaxed conditions. In other words, for all states the cost estimated by the heuristic is less than or equal to the actual cost of the solution; hence, it is an admissible heuristic.

vamp_wolf heuristic:
Consists of counting the number of warewolves in the west side of the river. The heuristic is admissible because the number of warewolves on the left side is equal or less than the minimum number of moves to be made to reach the solution from a given state. At the same time, it is a simple heuristic that makes use of constrain given by the problem (no more warewolves than vampires on any side) to indirectly make vampires move to the east side of the river without explicitly stating it in the heuristic.
